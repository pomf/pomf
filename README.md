# Important Notice
Please note that the development of this codebase has been surpassed by [Uguu](https://github.com/nokonoko/uguu). As a result, Pomf should be regarded as outdated since this code has not received updates for quite some time.

[Uguu](https://github.com/nokonoko/uguu) offers the identical appearance and functionality to Pomf, with the exception that you can skip the file expiration configuration during setup to achieve the exact same look and operation.
